## WORKING ENVIRONMENT

The files that the browser takes to start the page are located in the `/public` folder. This folder copies the entire contents of the files from the `/src` folder, which is the working environment where all the code has been written.

The files that display the page in GitHub Pages are located in the `/docs` folder.
